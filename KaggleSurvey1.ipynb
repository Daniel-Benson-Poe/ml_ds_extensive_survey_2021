A full list of these questions can be found by downloading the pdf provided by kaggle in the above hyperlink; I have also included a list of all the questions further down in this notebook under the \"Survey Questions\" section. For this project I chose to focus on specific questions including: age, gender, country of residence, highest level of education attained/planned to attain within the next 2 years, title most similar to current role, programming languages used regularly, programming languages recommended to learn, IDEs used regularly, notebooks used regularly, data visualization tools used regularly, number of yesars machine learning methods have been used, machine learning frameworks used regularly, machine learning algorithms used regularly, industry employers are in, platforms work is being shared on, data science course platforms used, data science media sources used, and degree/s held."
